My studies are focused on Software Engineering and architecting ICT Solutions. I got my Bachelor Degree at the University of Padua. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **data virtualization** in environments with highly heterogeneous data sources

âš¡ Fun fact: I recently **co-founded an Italian community** aiming to share and demistify trends and knowledge in the IT sector. The name of the project is NonCompila (literally "*it doesn't compile*") and we go live every wednesday at 7:15pm CET on [![Twitch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitch-%239146FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitch&logoColor=white)](https://www.twitch.tv/noncompila/about)

ðŸ§—: I fell in love with bouldering in 2021 and I have been climbing hard since then
