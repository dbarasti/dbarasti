âš¡ Fun fact: in December 2021 **I co-founded an Italian community** aiming to share and demystify trends and knowledge in the IT sector. The name of the project is NonCompila (literally "it doesn't compile") and we go live every Tuesday at 9pm CET on [![Twitch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitch-%239146FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitch&logoColor=white)](https://www.twitch.tv/noncompila/about)
